# The-idea-of-a-plan
A study plan generator for academics
The idea is to take away the effort of planing, allowing users to spend more time focused on learning and optimizing their learning efficiency
Ideally an tool that can be part of a larger learning omnibus

Planned Features:
* repository for assignments and upcoming tests in order to keep deadlines in focus
* Input estimates for times manually
* AI estimations for assignments that estimates the time it takes to do an assignment
* Alternative mode for self learners (self study with no teacher providing deadlines) will generate deadlines for you to keep you challenged
* Leitner system implemented for spaced repetition. 
* Connects to Google Calendar to perform two way communication, allowing study times to be scheduled into your calendar while avoiding busy times
* Option to enable flow work, blocking off 90 minute sessions
* Option to enable pomodoro with variable timing, blocking off 25 minute sessions with 5 minute breaks
* Option to enable spaced repetition, attempting to space work sessions for the same subject to boost retention
